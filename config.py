### About This App
This tool identifies unfilled candlestick wicks - a powerful pattern where price tends to return and "fill" the wick, especially in cases of long upside wicks with small bodies. Historical data shows approximately 99% of significant wicks eventually get filled.

### Strategy Guide
- Focus on upside wicks (wicks pointing up)
- Use as an investment tool, not for day trading
- Apply DCA (Dollar Cost Average) in the wick's direction
- Be patient - some wicks may take weeks/months to fill
- Success rate is ~99% for significant wicks
